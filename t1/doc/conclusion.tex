\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the circuit has been
achieved. Voltage and currents of resistors have been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results does not matched the theoretical results
precisely. The reason for this may be due to the errors been made during theoretical analysis when doing algebra and computing the equations.
